# **Predicting-Employee-Resignations-Using-Data-Science-and-HR-Analytics**

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques. It analyzes key factors influencing attrition and builds a classification model to identify employees at risk of leaving the organization. The objective is to help HR professionals make data-informed decisions to improve retention strategies and workforce stability.

## üìä Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict which employees are likely to leave the company.
- **Dataset**: HR data containing employee demographics, job roles, income, promotion history, and more.
- **Approach**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning model building, evaluation, and deployment.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data preprocessing and manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model training and evaluation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization and EDA
- **SHAP (optional)**: Model interpretability
- **Joblib**: Model serialization
- **Google Colab**: Development environment
- **Power BI**: (Optional) Dashboard integration

## üîÑ Project Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant columns, handled nulls, and encoded categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigated trends in attrition by department, salary, promotion timing, etc.
3. **Model Training**: Trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers.
4. **Model Selection**: Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment**: Saved the best model and exported processed datasets for future use and visualization.

## üìà Key Insights from EDA

- Employees in **Sales** and **Human Resources** exhibited higher attrition.
- **Lower salary bands** were associated with increased likelihood of leaving.
- **Frequent overtime** and **lack of recent promotion** were major drivers of attrition.

---

## ‚úÖ Results

- **Best Model**: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 76.4%
- **Recall (Attrition = Yes)**: 68%
- **Precision**: Balanced across both classes
- Visual assets such as confusion matrix and EDA plots included in the project outputs.

---

## üìå Recommendations

- Review salary structures for lower-income employees
- Improve promotion policies and transparency
- Monitor employee workload and overtime patterns
- Use predictive insights to proactively address potential attrition cases
